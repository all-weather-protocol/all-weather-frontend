‚è∫ Based on my comprehensive analysis of
your DeFi application, I've identified
significant performance issues on both
frontend and backend sides. Here's a
summary of the key findings:

üî¥ Critical Frontend Issues

React Performance Problems:

- Dashboard component
  (dashboard.tsx:145-197): Large config
  arrays recreated on every render
- IndexOverviews
  (indexOverviews.jsx:555-708): 150+ line
  useEffect with sequential API calls
- Missing optimizations: No React.memo,
  useCallback, or useMemo where needed
- Inefficient state management: Direct
  mutations, oversized props objects

üî¥ Critical Backend/API Issues

Sequential API Calls:

- Dashboard data fetching: Sequential
  instead of parallel requests (60-70%
  slower)
- Portfolio metadata: Individual API
  calls for each pool instead of batch
  requests
- Dust conversion: Rate limiting issues
  with insufficient delays

Inefficient Caching:

- Price data cache: Only 1 minute
  duration (too short)
- Missing batch endpoints: N+1 query
  patterns
- No retry mechanisms: Silent failures
  on API errors

DEX Aggregator Inefficiency:

- Always queries 3 providers even when
  one consistently outperforms
- No performance tracking or adaptive
  routing



High Impact - Backend:

1. Implement batch API endpoints -
   30-40% fewer requests
2. Extend cache durations (5-10 minutes
   for price data)
3. Add proper retry mechanisms with
   exponential backoff
4. Implement provider performance
   tracking for DEX calls
