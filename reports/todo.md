## Recommendations for Future Development

### 1. Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Are expensive functions wrapped in useCallback?
- [ ] Are complex calculations memoized with useMemo?
- [ ] Are components wrapped with React.memo where appropriate?
- [ ] Are timeouts and intervals properly cleaned up?

### 2. Performance Monitoring

- Consider adding React DevTools Profiler in development
- Monitor bundle size impact of memoization
- Track render counts in critical user flows

### 3. Continued Optimization Opportunities

- Evaluate useTransition for non-urgent updates
- Implement virtualization for large lists if needed

This comprehensive optimization effort significantly improves the application's performance while maintaining all existing functionality and preventing memory leaks.

## ðŸš€ Future Recommendations

1. **Code Review Process:** Add memory leak checks to PR reviews
2. **Testing:** Consider adding tests that verify cleanup behavior
3. **Documentation:** Update component guidelines to emphasize cleanup patterns
4. **Monitoring:** Consider runtime monitoring for memory usage in production

ðŸ“Š Bundle & Assets Issues

Large Asset Load:

- 8,234 image files (1.6MB+ just for
  chain images)

âš¡ Priority Fixes (Immediate Impact)

High Impact - Frontend:

1. Move queriesForAllWeather outside
   render - 60-70% improvement
2. Parallelize dashboard API calls -
   50-60% faster loading
3. Add React.memo to table components -
   Reduce unnecessary re-renders
4. Implement debounced resize handlers -
   Fix memory leaks

Issue #4: Protocol Code Splitting (30 minutes, good impact)

3. Protocol Code Splitting (30 minutes, good impact)

- Implement dynamic imports for protocol-specific components
- Expected Impact: Smaller initial bundle, faster startup

Which of these would you like me to implement first? The
dashboard array memoization would give the quickest win with
massive performance improvement.
