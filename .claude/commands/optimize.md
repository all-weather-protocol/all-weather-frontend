1. Read the whole project if needed. If you do, update both CLAUDE.md and MAINTAINABILITY_PLAN.md to reflect your understanding and any changes.
2. Check the todo tasks in MAINTAINABILITY_PLAN.md and proceed step by step. Prioritize optimizations with the highest impact (e.g., memory, performance, maintainability).
3. Always validate your changes by running tests. Use `doppler run -- yarn coverage` for the full suite, or `doppler run -- npx vitest __tests__/<file>` to run specific tests.
4. Add or update test cases to cover your changes.
5. Run `yarn format` and `yarn lint` to ensure code quality.
6. Update MAINTAINABILITY_PLAN.md and any other relevant documentation after completing each task.
7. If you encounter ambiguity or uncertainty, ask for clarification before proceeding.
